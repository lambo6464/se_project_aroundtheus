**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

I have screen shoots showing you how the project was made.

First started with the Fonts:

I will also provide the link to the google fonts page:

Here are screen shoots on the semantic tags for Media:
Tablet Mode 900px part 1:
<img src="../images/tablet resolution 900 part 1.png" />
Tablet Mode 900px part 2:
<img scr="../images/tablet resolution 900 part 2.png" />

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
